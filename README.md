# Real-Time-Weather-Data-Pipeline
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time weather data processing pipeline. 
The pipeline leverages OpenWeather API for hourly data collection, Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Spark Streaming for data transformation, and MongoDB for storing both raw and processed data. The pipeline is designed to provide timely insights into weather patterns through a dashboard updated daily.

And this is the workflow for this project
